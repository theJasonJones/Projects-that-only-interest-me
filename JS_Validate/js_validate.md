#JS Validation

As you have seen, this is my homemade JS validation code. I had to to this once for while I was working for a web design agency (Look closely at the IDs and get an idea of what the project was) and decided to make and own and improve on it occasionally. 

It's far from perfect at this point in time. But it'll get there one day.
