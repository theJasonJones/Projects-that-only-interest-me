#JS Validation

As you have probably seen, this is my custom for client validation on a form. I had to create this while I was working for a web design agency (Look closely at the IDs and get an idea of what the project was) and I decided I would put it here and gradually improve it over time. 

It's far from perfect at this point in time. But it'll get there one day.
